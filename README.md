  ## Description
  
  A way to quickly write a README by answering a couple of simple questions.

  ## Installation

  You need to have Node.js installed (version 16.18 preferably). To install the dependencies needed you will need to run the following command line: npm install 

  ## Usage

  To create a README.md file, you will need to run the following command line from the rootfolder: node index.js 
  You will then answer each of the prompted questions which will give the information needed for each section of the README.
  When the final question has been answered you will be notified that the file has been created, and will see it appear in the folder.
  You cn then preview the README by right-clicking and selecting 'open preview'.
